# Morphological-operations-of-opening-and-erosion-for_skeletalization
Embark on a journey into the world of image processing with my latest project, where I delved into the fascinating realm of morphological operations, specifically opening and erosion, to achieve skeletalization of images. The goal was to extract essential features, simplifying the structure while preserving important details.


Morphological Opening: 
Implemented the opening operation to smooth and reduce noise in the images, enhancing the subsequent skeletalization process. This involved a combination of erosion followed by dilation, effectively eliminating small structures.

Erosion for Skeletalization:
Employed erosion to thin out structures, creating a skeletal representation of the original image. This process involved iteratively removing pixels from the boundaries, emphasizing the core structure.

Erosion:
The filter operates on a multiplier (neighborhood) of pixels defined by the structural element.
If the structural element placed over a particular pixel touches the background, i.e. a point in the intersection is black, then the current pixel is sent to the background.

Dilatation:
It is the complementary of erosion, i.e. it replaces the current pixel with the maximum value in the multitude of pixels intersected by the structural object.
If the structural object reaches the first plane of the image, then the current pixel becomes white.
