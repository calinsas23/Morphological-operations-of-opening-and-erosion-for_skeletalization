# Morphological-operations-of-opening-and-erosion-for_skeletalization
Embark on a journey into the world of image processing with my latest project, where I delved into the fascinating realm of morphological operations, specifically opening and erosion, to achieve skeletalization of images. The goal was to extract essential features, simplifying the structure while preserving important details.
